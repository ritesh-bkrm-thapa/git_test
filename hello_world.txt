So far I have learned the following commands in git
    - git clone "SSH URL" inside my local repo folder
    - git remote -v to see the URL of my repository
So here fore the Git WorkFlow
    - I created a file inside the git_test folder using touch commands
    - used git status to see file those were not staged "Shown in red"
    - git add "file.extension", to add it to my local git repo
    - so to commit from stagin area 
        * I used git commit -m "Add Filename.extension" 
    - git log / shows the details of who made the changes
Modifying a File or Two
    - code . to open my repository files in Visual Studio
    - git add . to add all the files in the staging area
    - git commit -m "Edit README.md and hello_world.txt"
Note: you frequently use git status and git log 

Pushing files to Github
    - git push or git push origin main
